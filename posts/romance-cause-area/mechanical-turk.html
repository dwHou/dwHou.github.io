    <h2>AMT Disability Comparison Survey</h2>

    <p>
      The hard part of DALY estimation tends to be figuring out "disability weights"
      -- the amount that living in a condition is worse than baseline.
      A lot of effort has gone into estimating disability weights for various medical conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we aim to leverage these existing disability weight estimates
      into an estimate of the "disability" weight of being single.
      We do this by asking survey respondents whether, for various medical conditions, they would rather be single or have the condition but be in a good relationship:
    </p>

    <d-figure class="img-figure">
      <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/DisabilityComparisonQuestion.png" >
    </d-figure>

    <p>
      If they'd prefer being single, we get an approximate upper bound on their personal disability weight for being single.
      Conversely, if they'd take the condition for a good relationship, we get an estimated lower bound.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following table gives an overview of the conditions I surveyed on and candidate responses.
      I selected which conditions to use in the survey on several criteria:
      <b>(1)</b> Being common enough that subjects will roughly understand what they entail.
      <b>(2)</b> Not stigmatized (eg. not STDs).
      <b>(3)</b> Permanent (eg. not broken arm).
      <b>(4)</b> Spanning a variety of disability weights.
      <b>(5)</b> I preferred conditions the World Health Organization gives a weight for.
    </p>

  <p>
    For the 2019 version, I paid 100 respondents $0.5 each to fill out the survey, with the median respondent taking 1.8 minutes to fill it out.
    Respondents were <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> workers recruited using <a href="https://www.positly.com/">positly</a>.
    The pool was restricted to the US, but no other filters were applied (eg. on gender or age).
    Our response pool was male leaning (38% female)
    and age was widely distributed (median: 30-40).
    Most respondents were presently in a relationship (75%),
    and the majority had been in 2-4 serious relationships.
  </p>

  <p>
    (I had perviously run a survey covering a more diverse range romance-related questions in 2017. As discussed later, it's concerning that the gap in responses is so large!)
  </p>

  <p>
    We'd like to turn each respondents answers into an estimate of their disability weight for being single.
    A natural way to get a conservative estimate is to use the maximum disability weight of a condition they accepted in place of being single.
    This can be seen as an expressed lower bound.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, there are two issues with this approach.

    The first is that some respondents gave seemingly inconsistent responses;
    for example, one candidate might be willing to give up a finger for a relationship (0.102) but not have asthma (0.043).
    For these examples, we model responses as being effected by gaussian noise and then pick the maximum likelihood "true" single disability weight between the conflicting bounds.
    (See Appendix for details.)

    The other concern is that, even if the responses are consistent, taking the highest lower bound is taking a maximum over noisy estimates which is no longer an unbiased estimator.
    I didn't see a good way to get around this, but it doesn't seem to bad.
    It's an over-optimistic estimator, but it's an over-optimistic estimator of a lower bound, and still lower (for consistent reponses, where we're using) than the upper bound or maximum likelihood value.


  </p>

  <d-figure class="img-figure">
    <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/DisabilityComparisonEstimates.png" >
  </d-figure>

  <p>
    This gives an average disability weight of 0.2 DALY/LY (median: 0.14)
    (I other cases, I used median to be more robust to outliers. However, since the highest weight people can express here is was capped at 0.6,
    and outliers can have less of an effect, it felt more fair to average.)
    From here, we can use the estimate that the average American spends 14.8 years of their adult life single (see <a href="">appendix</a>)
    to get <b>2.96</b> DALY per capita.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have several significant concerns about data quality.

    (1) I ran a similar survey in 2017, on the same platform.
    I had an identically worded question about losing an arm versus being single,
    and at that point 58% of respondents said they would prefer to lose the arm, compared to 33% now.
    Some other experiments I ran suggest that the time of day effects response quite a bit.
    This suggests that either priming by the rest of the survey or shift in respondent distribution has significantly changed answers.

    (2) A number of respondents finished the survey in less than one minute, answering "prefer single" (top, constant answer) to each question;
    I'm concerned they may not have been actually engaging and just trying to rush through and collect the payment.

    (3) I'm worried that it may be hard for people to give honest answers,
    because romance is often so close to people's identity,
    or because the question becomes conflated with loyalty to a present partner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite these concerns, of all the methods I've explored for estimating disability weight, this is the one that feels most credible.
  </p>


    <h2>AMT Time-Trade Off Survey</h2>

    <p>
      This survey asks respondents to decide between living for 50 more years single,
      or a smaller number in a good relationship:
    </p>

    <d-figure class="img-figure">
      <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/TimeTradeoffQuestion.png" >
    </d-figure>

    <p>
      The survey dynamically asks a series of questions narrowing in on their "true preference",
      first in increments of ten years and then by binary
      search.

    </p>

    <p>
      Like the previous survey, this survey asks 100 <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>
      workers recruited using <a href="https://www.positly.com/">positly</a>
      questions probing their preference for good relationships relative to singlehood.
    </p>

    <d-figure class="img-figure">
      <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/TimeTradeoffEstimates.png" >
    </d-figure>

    <p>
      On its face, this methodology suggests a much higher disability weight than any other method I've tried,
      with a median of 0.45 DALY/LY (average: 0.53).
      It seems likely this is due to time discounting --
      our respondents may value time forty years in the future much less than they do the next couple of years.
      One reason this estimate may come out higher than others is time discounting.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we assume an exponential time discounting model,
      our median reconciles with risk of death a about 4% and with the disability-comparison estimate at about 6%.
      Both of these seem pretty aggressive, though.
      In the lack of a more principled answer, I looked at US treasury bonds and decided to go with 2.5%,
      which gives a median of 0.31.
    </p>

    <h2>AMT Risk of Death Survey</h2>

    <p>
      Our final mechanical turk survey for singlehood asks respondents to decide
      between a risk of death and being single:
    </p>

    <d-figure class="img-figure">
      <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/RiskOfDeathQuestion.png" >
    </d-figure>

    <p>
      Once again, we ask 100 <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>
      workers recruited using <a href="https://www.positly.com/">positly</a>
      questions probing their preference for good relationships relative to singlehood.
      As in the previous question, we use dynamic questions to search for the most extreme trade they'll accept.
    </p>

    <d-figure class="img-figure">
      <img style="width: 90%;" src="img/RiskOfDeathEstimates.png" >
    </d-figure>

    <p>
      This gives us a median of 0.25 DALY/LY.
      All our previous data and survey quality concerns persist.
    </p>
