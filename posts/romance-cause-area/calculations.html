        <h2>Average Number of Years Single</h2>

        <p>
          Based on FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-will-everyone-i-know-be-married/">“When Will Everyone I Know Be Married” article</a>,
          I estimated that the American spends 27 years of their adult life unmarried before the age of 75.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ran a small survey on Mechanical Turk in which I asked
          "Excluding any present long-term relationship, what fraction of your adult life have you spent single?"
          The average response was 55%.
          Combining these together, we get a crude estimate that the average American to spend 14.8 years single
          (and, conversely, about 40 in relationships).
        </p>


        <h2>Average Number of Years in Bad Relationships</h2>

        <p>
          Lucas et al <d-cite key="lucas2003reexamining"></d-cite> report that the "-1 standard deviation"
          outcome of marriage seems to be a ~10% reduction in baseline happiness.
          This seems like a decent operational definition of a bad relationship to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          But what fraction of the population is effected by this?
          In order to make estimates based on this data, we'll need to assume a Gaussian distribution.
          Well, -1 standard deviations suggests that 15% of the population decrease by at least that much,
          but could support 37% of the population to decrease by that much on average.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since I have very little understanding of the actual underlying data and wish to be conservative,
          I'm going to stick with 15%.
          If we take from above that people spend, on average, 40 years in relationships,
          this suggests the average person spends about 6 years in bad relationships.
        </p>


        <h2>Suicide life-year cost per capita</h2>

        <p>
          To estimate the number of life years lost to suicide per capita,
          I combine the CDC
          <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/LCWK1_2015.pdf">2015 leading causes of death by age group</a>
          data with <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">2015 life expectancy data</a>.
          For each age group, I multiply the suicide rate by the number of years in the age group and by life expectancy of the median age.
          This gives me estimates of how many life years are lost per capita per age group, which I sum for a full estimate.
          This is only a first-order estimate, and doesn't account for how suicide influences life expectancy.
          It does not attempt to account for comorbidity of suicide with mental health conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This leads to an estimate of <b>0.38 life years per capita</b>.
          You can think of this as meaning that, if suicide didn't exist, average life expectancy would increase by 0.38.
          (One interesting observation is that, while suicide rate peaks in the 50-54 age group,
          the life year cost peaks in the 15-19 age group.)
        </p>
